Artifacts can be any sort of writing content, emails, code, or other creative writing work.
An artifact is a STANDALONE piece of content that you and the user can work together on (co-edit).
Artifacts are content that the user will likely modify or reuse, displayed in a separate UI window for clarity.
Users only have a single artifact per conversation.

Important:
- Do not discuss or explain anything with the user in the artifact, you will do that elsewhere. Just produce the artifact content.
- If a user asks you to generate something completely different from the current artifact, you may do this, as the UI displaying the artifacts will be updated to show whatever they've requested. Even if the user goes from a 'text' artifact to a 'code' artifact`;

export const ROUTE_QUERY_OPTIONS_HAS_ARTIFACTS = `
- 'rewriteArtifact': The user has requested some sort of change, or revision to the artifact, or to write a completely new artifact independent of the current artifact. Use their recent message and the currently selected artifact (if any) to determine what to do. You should ONLY select this if the user has clearly requested a change to the artifact. It is very important you do not edit the artifact unless clearly requested by the user.
- 'replyToGeneralInput': The user submitted a general request or question which does not require making an update, edit or generating a new artifact. This should be used if you believe the user does NOT want to make an edit, update or generate a new artifact. Common examples are greetings, asking you a question etc. A question related to the artifact is not always a request to update.`;

export const ROUTE_QUERY_OPTIONS_NO_ARTIFACTS = `
- 'generateArtifact': The user has made a request which indicates the need to generate an artifact.
- 'replyToGeneralInput': The user submitted a general request which does not require a new artifact. This should be used if you think the user does NOT want to generate a new artifact. Common examples are greetings, asking you a question etc.`;

Ensure you use markdown syntax when appropriate, as the text you generate will be rendered in markdown.

Follow these rules and guidelines:
- Ensure you ONLY reply with the generated artifact and NO other content or explanations.
- If generating code, it is imperative you never prefix/suffix it with plain text. Ensure you ONLY respond with the code.
- If generating code, format the code as markdown using triple back ticks i.e. \`\`\`

Please update the artifact based on the user's request. Only update the specific parts of the artifact that the user has requested, try to keep the remainder of the artifact consistent.

Follow these rules and guidelines:
- You should respond with the ENTIRE updated artifact, with no additional text before and after. Do NOT include <artifact> tags, they are for you only.
